# BI Mobile Games Privacy Policy

In this privacy policy, we will explain how Bouchard Industries Corp (Referred to as we, our, us or "Bouchard Industries Corp") and our external third party associates gather, utilize, analyze and share information about you within our mobile games. We take your privacy seriously. Your information will not be shared with anyone other than our third party associates listed in this privacy policy. We understand your privacy is important to you. We will do our best to collect minimal amounts of information.

If you do not agree to this privacy policy, do not download, use and/or play our mobile games. 

When you acquire, use and/or play our mobile games, you agree to this privacy policy. You agree that with your consent, we may collect information from you. 

Some of your data is collected by our third party associates. We are not responsible for the actions of our associates. We remain vigilant and consistently communicate with our associates to insure they do not collect unnecessary or excessive information about you. We also ensure they can meet all of your needs and rights. If one of our third party associates gets a data breach for any reason, we will notify you as soon as this information becomes available to us. With your consent, they can bring you tailored advertisements within our mobile games that will most likely interest you. If you do not wish to receive tailored ads, it is possible to toggle the consent option in the settings screen of our mobile games or when our mobile games first launches on a clean install. When our mobile games first launches, you will be asked if you consent to more private information being tracked. If you dismiss this prompt, you do not consent and private information will not be tracked. This option is also available in the setting screen. It is a button labeled "GDPR". More information will be tracked if this button in the setting screen is labeled "GDPR off" or if this button is greyed out in our mobile games. If the same button is labeled "GDPR on" and/or is the same brightness than the other buttons, minimal non-private information may be tracked from our third party associates and by "Bouchard Industries Corp". With the gdpr button labeled "GDPR on" and/or the button is the same brightness than the other buttons, Google will show non personalized ads. Apple and Google will still track some information through in app purchase and leaderboards.

Our third party associates provide us with API's through their SDK's that let us toggle on or off GDPR options. Some of their SDK's are closed source, meaning we cannot see their code. If for any reason they made mistakes in their software, they should be held responsible as we cannot see their code. But we will do our best to ensure that their API's are working correctly. 

Do not use private information when you create your account on Game Center or Google Play Games Services. One example would be someone placing their real name as a username for these services. This may be considered private information. With these services, you may have the option to chat with other players. Please do not share private information with these players. Do not add strangers as friends on these services as they may be able to see your real name even though you used a different name as your username. If you have any concerns over this, please contact us at: eric@bouchardindustries.com or contact Apple or Google depending on your device.

Some of our third party associates may read contents of your storage to check if ads are cached in order to save bandwidth and not download the ad again. They may delete those ads off your local storage if the ad is no longer available. Some specific ads are only shown when you are on wi-fi. They need to know if users are on wi-fi or not. Other data our third party associates may collect include: basic usage metrics, retention metrics, category interest profiles, category benchmarks, age/gender estimations, user acquisition analytics, ability to review city-level geographic data, device information, IP addresses, etc. You have the option to opt out of this information being logged. The reason this information is tracked is to bring you tailored ads, analyze demographics to see if it generally affects different behavior within the game, and to see if any device specific issues arise. To opt out of information being tracked from you by Apple and Google, you must contact them.
